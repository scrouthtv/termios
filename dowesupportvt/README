Detecting VT support
====================

Three possible outcomes:
 - VT emu supported
 - VT emu not supported
 - error occurred during testing

For testing whether it's supported:
 - try to set ENABLE_VIRTUAL_TERMINAL_PROCESSING
   - if no error returned -> VT emu is supported
   - if an error is returned, cast it to a syscall.Errno
     - if it is not a syscall.Errno -> error occurred during testing
		 - if it is one and it's value != 87 -> error occurred during testing
		 - if it is one and it's value == 87 -> V emu not supported
